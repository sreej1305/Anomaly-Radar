# Anomaly Radar

## Project Overview
Anomaly Radar is a Python-based system designed to ensure data integrity and reliability in dynamic environments. It is capable of:

- **Simulating Time-Based Datasets**: Generates realistic time-series data for testing and validation.
- **Detecting Anomalies & Drift**: Identifies outliers and distribution shifts in real-time.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Explains *why* data patterns have changed.
- **Visualizing Patterns**: Provides clear, actionable visualizations of drift and anomalies.

## Use Cases
This system is essential for:
- Data Engineering Pipelines
- Machine Learning Platforms (e.g., IBM, Google, Amazon)
- Real-time Monitoring Systems
