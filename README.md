# Anomaly Radar

## 🧠 What You Build

A Python system that:
- Simulates time-based datasets
- Detects anomalies & distribution drift
- Explains why data changed
- Visualizes drift patterns clearly

This is used heavily in:
- ✔ Data engineering
- ✔ ML platforms (IBM, Google, Amazon)
- ✔ Monitoring systems

## 🧩 Notebook Flow (Colab-Friendly)

### 1️⃣ Generate Time-Series Data
Simulate metrics like:
- User activity
- System load
- Revenue
- Error rate
